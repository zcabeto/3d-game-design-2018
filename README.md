# 3d-game-design-2018
after the Arts Award (see repository), I expanded my game creation to 3D...

this project I did in my own time during 2018 after inspiration from creating the game for my Arts Award. 
I especially worked on learning how to manipulate the camera and getting it to react to the player character backing up to walls.
Without looking too far into the graphics of the 3D assets, I looked at rudementary landscape design to create diversity in the terrain.

This project is one of many that I used to understand the mechanics of 3D game design better. Skills that I would love to revisit.
